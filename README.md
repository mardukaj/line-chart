# line-chart

In this example project i have created a library for drawing line charts on X, Y axes. 
Also i have made an live example for line chart.

- chart.html - Displays bar chart example. Inside of this file you can insert your data for generating new charts.
- scripts/canvasChart.js - In this file i have written the code for creating line chart.

-----------------------

2. Take any OOP language and create mini graphs (charts) library that is able to draw basic bar chart on X, Y axes. Create another chart type - line as just different visual representation for distinct values. 
Notes:
Demonstrate usage of OOP with classes, inheritance etc
Use any library for image drawing and generation that works with your language of choice. Result of your program might be JPG, PNG... image. Do not use existing graph libraries
